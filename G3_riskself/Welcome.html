    <h2>Game Instructions</h2>
<p>You will see 32 cards face down, with one bomb randomly hidden among them. You need to
decide how many cards you want to flip, and the software will automatically flip them
simultaneously.</p>

<p>You start with an initial endowment of 5 euros.</p>

<h2>Game Rules</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
<p>If you decide not to flip any cards, you lose your initial endowment of 5 euros.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
If you find the bomb, you lose your initial endowment and receive no reward.
    </li>
    <li>
If you do not find the bomb, your payoff will be 5 euros plus 0.25 euros for each card
you flipped.
    </li>
    
</ul>


<h2>Game Repetition</h2>

<p>The game will be repeated 5 times, with previous results not affecting future ones. Each
time, you will start with the initial endowment of 5 euros, and payoffs will be calculated the
same way. Your goal is to earn as much money as possible.</p>
