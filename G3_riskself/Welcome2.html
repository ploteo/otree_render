<h2>Trust game instructions</h2>
<p>You will now participate in the Trust Game. In this game, you will be randomly paired with
another participant: one of you will be randomly selected to play as the Investor and the
other as the Trustee.</p>
<h2>Investor Role</h2>
As the Investor, you will start with an initial amount of 10 euros. Then you will decide how
much money to send to the Trustee. The Trustee will receive that amount already multiplied
by 3 from the experimenter (e.g. if you choose to send X euros, the Trustee will receive 3X
euros).
<h2>Trustee Role</h2>
As the Trustee, you will decide how much money to send back to the Investor‚Äù
<h2>Payoffs</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
Investor Payoff: Amount kept + amount received back from the Trustee
    </li>
    <li>
Trustee Payoff: Amount received - amount sent back to the Investor
    </li>
</ul> 

<p>In the following pages, you will be asked to make choices, both as Investor and Trustee.
Then, the game will be played according to the choices made.</p>
