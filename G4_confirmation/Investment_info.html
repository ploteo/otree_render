<p>In this experiment, you will make investment decisions between two options:
Option A and Option B. Each option has distinct characteristics in terms of
risk and potential returns.</p>

<p>Investment Options Overview</p>

<ul>
    <li>
<b>Option A:</b> This is a low-volatility investment, meaning it experiences fewer
fluctuations in value. It is a stable choice, appealing to investors who prioritize
consistent returns and lower risk exposure.
    </li>
    <li>
<b>Option B:</b> This is a high-volatility investment, which means it is more prone to
value changes and offers the potential for higher returns. It is suited for investors
who are comfortable with market fluctuations.
    </li>
</ul>
