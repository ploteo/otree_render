<p>Given your current grade and monetary prize, according to the Italian university
system, you have <b>two options.</b></p>

<p>You can choose to either <b>accept your grade</b> along with the corresponding prize you
have earned, or <b>reject the grade.</b></p>

<p>Rejecting the grade will enter you into a lottery designed to simulate a scenario
where you decide to reject the result of an exam and retake it.</p>

<p>The retake exam can lead to three different outcomes that have all the same
probability.</p>

<p>The following table outlines the possible outcomes of rejecting the grade</p>

</div>

<p>NOTE: You have a <b>limited time</b> to decide. If no choice is made within the allotted
time, your grade will be <b>automatically rejected</b>.</p>

<p>Please ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of these options
before proceeding. </p>
