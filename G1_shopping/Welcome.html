<div class="container box">

<p>Thank you for joining us today. We are students from the Behavioral Economics class, and our goal is to study the
relationship between emotions and purchasing decisions.</p>

<p>There are two phases in this experiment:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
<p>In the first phase, you will complete a memory task where you’ll be asked to recall a sequence of numbers. Before and
after the task, you will be asked to rate your mood.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
<p>In the second phase, you will receive a virtual budget to spend on our products. You’ll choose how to allocate your
budget across different options.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you again for your participation! Click next if you’re ready for the experiment.</p>
